# Introduction

  * Coronavirus, also known as COVID-19, is a serious illness, caused by a contagious virus. It quickly spreads via contaminated surface-to-person contact and person-to-person contact. It is considered as a pandemic as it has spread over multiple countries or continents and has affected numerous people in different ways.

  * This infectious disease falls under respiratory disease. Symptoms observed amongst the infected people are in wide range which include mild fever to severe illness. It has caused numerous hospitalizations and deaths globally and particularly in the U.S.

  * Researchers around the world have created models to predict the trajectory of COVID-19. Models are not always perfect in making predictions, but they may be substantially useful if applied correctly. In case of COVID-19 responding to these models may be the difference between death tolls in the thousands or millions. On the basis of existing prediction models for COVID-19, CDC recommends the public to wear face masks in places with high population density because it is difficult to maintain social distancing or 6 feet distance.
